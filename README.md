## WORK IN PROGRESS

Voice typing without distractions

Default hotkey is `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + r`. This will start recording (should show an icon) and then press it again to stop recording and transcribe

Only tested on Linux for now...

Working on adding easier setup and stuff.

```npm run tauri dev```
