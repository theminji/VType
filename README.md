# VType
## WORK IN PROGRESS

Voice typing without distractions

Default hotkey is `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + r`. This will start recording (should show an icon) and then press it again to stop recording and transcribe

Only tested on Linux and Windows for now...

(Windows has a few glitches I need to iron out)

Working on adding easier setup and stuff.

### UPDATE

Linux binaries in [releases](https://github.com/theminji/VType/releases/tag/releases)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```
